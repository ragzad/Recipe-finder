# Recipe Finder Project: Scope and UX Goals

## Project Overview
A dynamic, interactive recipe search application where users can input ingredients to find recipes that match their preferences. The app will include advanced search filters, provide feedback for invalid inputs, and display results dynamically. It will be user-friendly, responsive, and adhere to accessibility guidelines.

## Target Audience
- **Food Enthusiasts**: Individuals who love cooking and exploring new recipes.
- **Meal Preppers**: Users planning weekly meals based on available ingredients.
- **Health-Conscious Individuals**: People with dietary restrictions or specific meal preferences.

## Goals and Features

### Core Features
1. **Ingredient-Based Search**:
   - Users input ingredients they have, and recipes will be fetched dynamically.
   - Display key recipe information like title, image, and cooking time.

2. **Advanced Filters**:
   - Include filters for dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).
   - Provide options to filter by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Clear feedback for invalid inputs ("Please enter at least one ingredient").
   - Graceful handling of API errors or empty results ("No recipes found").

### Additional Features (Optional for Distinction)
- **Save Favorites**: Allow users to bookmark recipes for later.
- **Random Recipe Suggestion**: Offer random recipes for users unsure of what to cook.

## Accessibility and UX Standards

### Accessibility (WAI-ARIA Compliance)
- Use semantic HTML ( `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`).
- Provide ARIA roles for interactive elements (buttons, search fields).
- Ensure all images have descriptive alt text.

### User Experience (UX) Principles
1. **Intuitive Navigation**:
   - Simple, minimalistic design.
   - Prominent search bar and clear filter options.
2. **Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Immediate feedback for invalid inputs or API errors.
   - Clear visual indicators of loading and successful searches.
3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Mobile-first layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox.
   - Ensure usability across devices and screen sizes.

### Project Deployment
- Host the app on a cloud-based platform like GitHub Pages.
- Use Git for frequent commits with descriptive messages.

- **Distinction**: Add optional features, achieve a professional UI/UX, and fully document development/testing.


# Recipe Finder - Patch Notes  
**Version: Latest**  
**Date: YYYY-MM-DD**

## Fixes and Improvements  

### 1. Fixed Recipe Count Issue  
The app was pulling **more recipes than requested**, sometimes showing extra or missing results.  
We made sure that it **always** returns the exact number you ask for by limiting the results with `.slice(0, recipeCount)`.  

---

### 2. Better Recipe Matching in Fallback Search  
When no exact matches were found, the app used to **show random recipes** instead of prioritizing the closest ones.  
Now, it **sorts recipes by how many ingredients match** and **removes bad matches**, so you get more relevant results.  

---

### 3. Removed Meal Type Filtering  
The meal type filter wasnâ€™t really affecting results, since the API doesn't support it well.  
We decided to **remove it completely** to avoid confusion and keep the search cleaner.  

---

### 4. Improved Recipe Display with Scrolling  
Instead of stacking recipes in a long list, they now **scroll horizontally** in a neat carousel.  
This makes it **easier to browse** through multiple options.  

---

### 5. Improved Loading and Error Messages  
- Added `"Loading recipes..."` while fetching results.  
- If no exact matches are found, it now says `"No exact matches found. Showing closest recipes instead."`  
- Errors are now clearer so you know what went wrong.
