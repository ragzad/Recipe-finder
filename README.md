# Recipe Finder Project: Scope and UX Goals

## Project Overview
A dynamic, interactive recipe search application where users can input ingredients to find recipes that match their preferences. The app will include advanced search filters, provide feedback for invalid inputs, and display results dynamically. It will be user-friendly, responsive, and adhere to accessibility guidelines.

---

## Target Audience
- **Food Enthusiasts**: Individuals who love cooking and exploring new recipes.
- **Meal Preppers**: Users planning weekly meals based on available ingredients.
- **Health-Conscious Individuals**: People with dietary restrictions or specific meal preferences.

---

## Goals and Features

### Core Features
1. **Ingredient-Based Search**:
   - Users input ingredients they have, and recipes will be fetched dynamically.
   - Display key recipe information like title, image, and cooking time.

2. **Advanced Filters**:
   - Include filters for dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).
   - Provide options to filter by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Clear feedback for invalid inputs ("Please enter at least one ingredient").
   - Graceful handling of API errors or empty results ("No recipes found").

### Additional Features (Optional for Distinction)
- **Save Favorites**: Allow users to bookmark recipes for later.
- **Random Recipe Suggestion**: Offer random recipes for users unsure of what to cook.

## Accessibility and UX Standards

### Accessibility (WAI-ARIA Compliance)
- Use semantic HTML ( `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`).
- Provide ARIA roles for interactive elements (buttons, search fields).
- Ensure all images have descriptive alt text.

### User Experience (UX) Principles
1. **Intuitive Navigation**:
   - Simple, minimalistic design.
   - Prominent search bar and clear filter options.
2. **Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Immediate feedback for invalid inputs or API errors.
   - Clear visual indicators of loading and successful searches.
3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Mobile-first layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox.
   - Ensure usability across devices and screen sizes.

## Technical Requirements

### Tools and Technologies
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **API**: Spoonacular API or similar for recipe data.
- **Testing**: Automated/manual testing (e.g., Jest, Cypress).
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for incremental development and deployment.

### Project Deployment
- Host the app on a cloud-based platform like GitHub Pages.
- Use Git for frequent commits with descriptive messages.

---

## Success Metrics
- **Pass**: Functional app with basic ingredient search and responsive layout.
- **Merit**: Include advanced filters, error handling, and thorough documentation.
- **Distinction**: Add optional features, achieve a professional UI/UX, and fully document development/testing.


# Recipe Finder - Patch Notes  
**Version: 1.1**  
**Date: YYYY-MM-DD**  

---

## Fixes and Improvements  

### 1. Fixed Recipe Count Issue  
The app was pulling **more recipes than requested**, sometimes showing extra or missing results.  
We made sure that it **always** returns the exact number you ask for by limiting the results with `.slice(0, recipeCount)`.  

---

### 2. Better Recipe Matching in Fallback Search  
When no exact matches were found, the app used to **show random recipes** instead of prioritizing the closest ones.  
Now, it **sorts recipes by how many ingredients match** and **removes bad matches**, so you get more relevant results.  

---

### 3. Removed Meal Type Filtering  
The meal type filter wasnâ€™t really affecting results, since the API doesn't support it well.  
We decided to **remove it completely** to avoid confusion and keep the search cleaner.  

---

### 4. Improved Recipe Display with Scrolling  
Instead of stacking recipes in a long list, they now **scroll horizontally** in a neat carousel.  
This makes it **easier to browse** through multiple options.  

---

### 5. Improved Loading and Error Messages  
- Added `"Loading recipes..."` while fetching results.  
- If no exact matches are found, it now says `"No exact matches found. Showing closest recipes instead."`  
- Errors are now clearer so you know what went wrong.

# Recipe Finder - Patch Notes  
**Version: 1.2 (Latest)**  
**Date: 29/01/2025**  

---

## Fixes and Improvements  

### 1. Improved Recipe Card Layout (Horizontal Scrolling)  
- Restored **horizontal scrolling** for recipe cards while keeping ingredients vertically stacked.  
- Adjusted **styling** to ensure a cleaner, more readable layout.  

#### Problem Faced:  
- Recipe cards were stacking **vertically**, making navigation less user-friendly.  

#### How We Fixed It:  
- Reverted to **horizontal scrolling** while ensuring **ingredients stack properly** within each card.  

---

### 2. Added a "See More" Button for Long Ingredient Lists  
- Limited the **default ingredient list to 7 items**.  
- Added a `"See More"` button when recipes contain more than 7 ingredients.  
- Clicking the button expands the full list, preventing large recipe cards.  

#### Problem Faced:  
- Recipes with **long ingredient lists** were making some cards too large, breaking the layout.  

#### How We Fixed It:  
- Implemented a **toggle feature** that expands or collapses the ingredient list dynamically.  

---

### 3. Improved Ingredient Matching (Fuzzy Search)  
- **Now detects partial ingredient matches** (e.g., `"egg"` matches `"hard boiled eggs"` or `"9 eggs"`).  
- Allows for more **flexible searching** and avoids missing valid matches.  

#### Problem Faced:  
- **Exact text matching** was preventing valid ingredient recognition.  
- `"egg"` and `"hard boiled eggs"` were treated as different items.  

#### How We Fixed It:  
- Updated ingredient comparison logic to use **partial string matching** with `.includes()`.  

---

### 4. Improved Nutrition Display  
- **Nutrition info (calories, protein, carbs, fats) now fits correctly inside recipe cards**.  
- Adjusted **text wrapping** to prevent overflow.  

#### Problem Faced:  
- Nutrition details were **overflowing the recipe card**, making some text unreadable.  

#### How We Fixed It:  
- Applied **CSS fixes** to properly stack macros inside each card.  
- Ensured **text wraps instead of overflowing**.
